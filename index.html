        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Welcome to my Work Term Report. This page outlines my experience working at Sonova as a
          <strong><u>Software Quality Assurance Analyst</u></strong>, from <i>September 9, 2022 - December 24, 2022.</i>
        </p>
        <p>My name is Elman Islam. I'm a 3rd year software engineering student at the University of Guelph. I was super excited 
          when I first got the job, because it meant after so long that I would get real hands-on experience with what I consider 
          to be one of the most crucial steps of the Software Development Lifecycle: Testing and Integration.
        </p>
        <p>During my experience at Sonova, I learned a lot about quality assurance, specifically testing software.
          The products Sonova sells are super high-tech hearing instruments, and my job was to make sure the software
          for these devices was functioning properly.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <p>My first goal was to write detailed notes to keep track of my work progress and reflect my test results 
          for others to see. It is necessary in this job role to take a lot of notes to keep track of what cases were completed, 
          what needs to be completed, important concepts, bug reports, and much more. My second goal was to adequately understand 
          every relevant testing method inside and out, because much of the work consists of following test procedures with 
          specific terminology that I needed to understand before conducting any tests. My last goal was to be more vocal in scrum
          and stand-up meetings, because I know I'm a quiet person but I wanted to leave an impact during my co-op term. Regarding
          my second goal, I wanted to improve my skills that involve testing software, because I know testing takes a large portion of time 
          for programmers and is crucial to keep code from breaking. I therefore aimed on getting experience with all sorts of test 
          methodologies: black box, regression, smoke, unit, integration and maintenance testing were all skills I improved on
          during this term.
