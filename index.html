        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Welcome to my Work Term Report. This page outlines my experience working at Sonova as a
          <strong><u>Software Quality Assurance Analyst</u></strong>, from <i>September 9, 2022 - December 24, 2022.</i>
        </p>
        <p>My name is Elman Islam. I'm a 3rd year software engineering student at the University of Guelph. I was super excited 
          when I first got the job, because it meant after so long that I would get real hands-on experience with what I consider 
          to be one of the most crucial steps of the Software Development Lifecycle: Testing and Integration.
        </p>
        <p>During my experience at Sonova, I learned a lot about quality assurance, specifically testing software.
          The products Sonova sells are super high-tech hearing instruments, and my job was to make sure the software
          for these devices was functioning properly.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <p>My first goal was to write detailed notes to keep track of my work progress and reflect my test results 
          for others to see. It is necessary in this job role to take a lot of notes to keep track of what cases were completed, 
          what needs to be completed, important concepts, bug reports, and much more. My second goal was to adequately understand 
          every relevant testing method inside and out, because much of the work consists of following test procedures with 
          specific terminology that I needed to understand before conducting any tests. My last goal was to be more vocal in scrum
          and stand-up meetings, because I know I'm a quiet person but I wanted to leave an impact during my co-op term. Regarding
          my second goal, I wanted to improve my skills that involve testing software, because I know testing takes a large portion of time 
          for programmers and is crucial to keep code from breaking. I therefore aimed on getting experience with all sorts of test 
          methodologies: black box, regression, smoke, unit, integration and maintenance testing were all skills I improved on
          during this term.

        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>It is without a doubt that I owe a nice, big thank you to all the talented folk I got to meet during my first
          ever co-op experience. 8 letters are not enough to justify the enormous gratitude I have for the kind people who made up the 
          wonderful community I was part of. First of all, I would like to thank Chris Paiva, one of my senior supervisors and the man who 
          interviewed me. I would still be stuck figuring out how to check my Microsoft Office calendar and many other features if he didn't teach 
          me and help me out so much. I also thank Mishel Ukhanov, my other supervisor, for also helping with all sorts of questions I had and 
          helping me set up my fitting software and equipment. No one soaked up more of my questions than Teran Cloet, and I have my upmost
          thanks for that. Not only did he seamlessly answer each and every one of my pesterous questions flawlessly, he also wrote the 
          critical feedback I got for my final employer evaluation. He also introduced me to the small personal project I worked on called Ask Alex.
          Speaking of personal projects, I would like to thank a fellow guelph co-op student in the same position as me during the term, and he is William Siong.
          We worked through the same test scenarios, personal project, and struggles, and if he didn't have my back I would have spent much more time scratching my 
          head in confusion. Big thanks to Noah Macgillivray, another new hire (and former guelph co-op student) who also had my back and drove me to 
          the office occasionally. Lastly, I thank the rest of the SQA team. My only regret is that I wished I went to the office more often so I could 
          have met you all in person.
