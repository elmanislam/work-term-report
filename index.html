        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Welcome to my Work Term Report. This page outlines my experience working at Sonova as a
          <strong><u>Software Quality Assurance Analyst</u></strong>, from <i>September 9, 2022 - December 24, 2022.</i>
        </p>
        <p>My name is Elman Islam. I'm a 3rd year software engineering student at the University of Guelph. I was super excited 
          when I first got the job, because it meant after so long that I would get real hands-on experience with what I consider 
          to be one of the most crucial steps of the Software Development Lifecycle: Testing and Integration.
        </p>
        <p>During my experience at Sonova, I learned a lot about quality assurance, specifically testing software.
          The products Sonova sells are super high-tech hearing instruments, and my job was to make sure the software
          for these devices was functioning properly.

          I worked under several supervisors at the Kitchener office, who were all senior Software Quality Assurance Analysts. My main
          supervisors were Mishel Ukhanov and Chris Paiva, two members of the SQA team I was part of who showcased me the fitting software 
          I would use for the hearing instruments.

      <div class="textBox">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <hr>
        
        <p>My first goal was to write detailed notes to keep track of my work progress and reflect my test results 
          for others to see. It is necessary in this job role to take a lot of notes to keep track of what cases were completed, 
          what needs to be completed, important concepts, bug reports, and much more. My second goal was to adequately understand 
          every relevant testing method inside and out, because much of the work consists of following test procedures with 
          specific terminology that I needed to understand before conducting any tests. My last goal was to be more vocal in scrum
          and stand-up meetings, because I know I'm a quiet person but I wanted to leave an impact during my co-op term. Regarding
          my second goal, I wanted to improve my skills that involve testing software, because I know testing takes a large portion of time 
          for programmers and is crucial to keep code from breaking. I therefore aimed on getting experience with all sorts of test 
          methodologies: black box, regression, smoke, unit, integration and maintenance testing were all skills I improved on
          during this term.

        <h2>Job Description</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>As a participative, hands-on member of the Software Quality Assurance team, I was responsible for executing 
          and maintaining manual test scripts for different applications, performing manual regression testing, as well as 
          preparing the required documentation.</p>
        <p>

          <h3>Fitting Software</h3>
          <p> Hearing aids are amazing, complex devices capable of a plethora of different features. In order to adjust these
            features to the patient's needs, <strong><em>fitting software</em></strong> is used. For example, there is a feature
            called tinnitus masker which generates and emits broad-band or narrow-band noise at low levels, designed to mask the presence of tinnitus
            in a patient's ears. The fitting software would be used to adjust how low that level should be and at what frequency range. 
            Another more simple example is toggling the startup sound delay of the hearing instrument. My job was to make sure that all
            of these functionalities within the fitting software works properly as intended. If I tested to make sure the tinnitus masker was
            actually working, I would take a sample hearing instrument, run the software for it, and check to ensure the tinnitus masker feature works
            as intended when I adjust its input values.
          </p>

      <h3>Testing Methodologies</h3>
      <p>An important concept that I learned in university is testing code and software. It is a crucial part of the Software
        Development Lifecycle, but I didn't recognize its importance until I did this work term. There are various documents I 
        had to read called <strong><em>test scenarios</strong></em> and <strong><em>test cases</strong></em>. <strong><em>Test cases</strong></em> are procedures of individual steps that assess each feature
        of an application. A <strong><em>test scenario</strong></em> is a collective set of test cases which makes up a specific functionality of the 
        software. For example, if I were doing a test case about the GUI of the software, I would verify that the appropriate 
        icons, text and buttons appear as specified in the case, and then I would make sure these buttons and icons work properly
        when I click adjust or otherwise change them.
      </p>
      <p > As for how these cases are actually conducted, there are several methods to test a piece of software. Generally speaking, the mindset of the software tester is 
        "How can I break this piece of software?" Good to know because I'm much better at breaking things than building them. Simply testing that a software gives the expected
        output is not nearly enough to rigorously verify that the software is functioning properly. Just because it works doesn't mean there's potential bugs in it.
        Software testing can generally be 
      divided into two types: <strong><em>functional</strong></em> and <strong><em>non-functional</strong></em> testing.Functional testing ensures that the functions and features of the 
      application work properly. Non-functional testing examines other aspects of how well the application works.
      Functional testing tests the functionality of an app. Non-functional testing tests the performance of these functions.
      <strong><em>Maintenance testing</strong></em> is usually re-running functional and
      non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs as expected after a change.
      Most of the testing I conducted fell into this category, specifically regression testing. I tested older versions of the fitting
      software to make sure they still ran smoothly and if there were any bugs, I would report them. A <strong><em>bug</strong></em> is when a feature or piece
      of code does not work as intended, and it must be reported in order to have it fixed by a developer.
      </p>
      <p > Once a test is conducted, a document called a <strong><em>test report</strong></em> is filled up to specify how the process went. If the test failed, 
        usually it is due to the presence of a bug and that bug also gets documented in a <strong><em>bug report</strong></em>. Whether it passes or fails, the test will
        be viewable on whatever website or tool the company uses to record documents. In Sonova's case, I worked with an Application Lifecycle Management website called <strong><em>Polarion.</strong></em>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <hr>
  
        <p>This experience taught me that testing and quality assurance is a crucial component to the software Development Lifecycle. It was my
          first time being part of a large technical organization and only after this work term did I understand the vast applications of software
          development across the world. I will be sure to apply the testing techniques I have learned to my academic projects in school to produce clean 
          and easy-to-use software. It astonishes me to think there are thousands of other corporations of equal magnitude to Sonova that produce
          fascinating pieces of technology on the go. I hope to one day be designing and developing evolutionary software myself, just like Sonova.

        <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>It is without a doubt that I owe a nice, big <strong>thank you</strong> to all the talented folk I got to meet during my first
          ever co-op experience. 8 letters are not enough to justify the enormous gratitude I have for the kind people who made up the 
          wonderful community I was part of. First of all, I would like to thank Chris Paiva, one of my senior supervisors and the man who 
          interviewed me. I would still be stuck figuring out how to check my Microsoft Office calendar and many other features if he didn't teach 
          me and help me out so much. I also thank Mishel Ukhanov, my other supervisor, for also helping with all sorts of questions I had and 
          helping me set up my fitting software and equipment. No one soaked up more of my questions than Teran Cloet, and I have my upmost
          thanks for that. Not only did he seamlessly answer each and every one of my pesterous questions flawlessly, he also wrote the 
          critical feedback I got for my final employer evaluation. He also introduced me to the small personal project I worked on called Ask Alex.
          Speaking of personal projects, I would like to thank a fellow guelph co-op student in the same position as me during the term, and he is William Siong.
          We worked through the same test scenarios, personal project, and struggles, and if he didn't have my back I would have spent much more time scratching my 
          head in confusion. Big thanks to Noah Macgillivray, another new hire (and former guelph co-op student) who also had my back and drove me to 
          the office occasionally. Lastly, I thank the rest of the SQA team. My only regret is that I wished I went to the office more often so I could 
          have met you all in person.
